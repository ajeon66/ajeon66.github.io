			<h3>A mini project to force me to match facts with theory, since I think theoretically all the time.</h3>

			<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Louis Pasteur said "where observation is concerned, chance favors only the prepared mind." For me, there are three components to intellectual growth: observation, intake, and reflection. Observation is by far the component that I pay the least attention to, and this page is an attempt to give more effort to observation.</p>

<p>In other words, I'm just trying to trick myself into not being a theoretical-head-in-the-clouds geek. Mind you, the news articles listed here are not the most important or interesting, but more a reflection of what I am able to address.</p>

	<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-04/saudi-arabia-sticks-to-demand-for-opec-extension-through-2022">UAE</a> refuses to budge on OPEC+ deal. Long-term allies UAE and Saudi Arabia are expressing their differences, with the former refusing to sign the deal that extends into 2022. UAE agreed to the current baseline in April 2020, but an extension of this baseline into 2022 is undesirable, as they have invested heavily in production capacity.</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-04/chinese-astronauts-make-first-space-walk-outside-new-station">Astronauts</a> make first spacewalk outside of the Tiangong space station, installing cameras and other equipment on the Tianhe core module. The space station is part of the larger Tiangong project, beginning in 1992. [1] <div class="marginnote">[1] Apparently NASA refused China's involvement in the ISS's construction, which heightened China's incentives to build their own station.</div>The launch of the Tianhe core module in April 2021 marks the start of the program's deployment.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[2] Lithography machines are used to etch circuit designs on silicon wafers. ASML uses a special grand of lithography called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which uses extreme ultraviolet for etching.</div>
	<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/04/technology/tech-cold-war-chips.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">ASML</a> lies at the center of the semiconductor war. The Dutch semiconductory company possesses the technology to push past the performance barrier. However, being a company that has a near-monopoly on EUV lithography machines [2], the company is getting shut into the US-China war.</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/fed-sanguine-inflation-view-recalls-arthur-burns-by-stephen-s-roach-2021-05">Stephen S. Roach</a> talks about inflation. This is an older opinion piece from May 2021, but highlights bigger themes surrounding inflation this time around. Roach remembers Arthur Burns' philosophy surrounding inflation - Burns believed that price trends are largely affected by transitory noise that has nothing to do with monetary policy. Hence he sought to reduce the consumer price index (CPI) to products that were independent of noise, at one point excluding energy and food products. Only when the resulting CPI continued to rise at a double-digit rate did Burns acknowledge America's inflation problem.

	<p>This highlights the dangers of cherry-picking: picking "nicer" data points to see a desired result like a lower significance level. Furthermore, the delineation between COVID and normalcy can be dangerous; treating COVID as merely a passing phase encourages a Burns-esque philosophy that increases in various consumer products will disappear once COVID is "over".</p></li>

	<div class="marginnote">[1] I think this highlights a number of interesting things. 
		<ol>
			<li>Power graphs (i.e. the distribution of power) are important, and they are not always equivalent to the distribution of agents.</li>
			<li>We sometimes forget, but software - and technology in general - is hard. The costs of implementing in-house systems for small/medium-sized businesses that are not in the tech space are far greater than just getting a third-party to take care of everything.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8e7c9a2-5819-424f-b087-c6f2e8f0c7a1">Hackers</a> hit Kaseya, an IT software provider, to spread ransomware. Consequently, many of Sweden's Coop grocery chain stores, which depend on Kaseya for their cash register and self-checkout systems, remained closed. This attack suggests the dependence of many small/medium-sized companies on centralized third parties for their IT service needs. [1]</li>
	<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/">Digital Forensics</a> presents an <a href="https://www.digitalviolence.org/#/">interactive timeline</a> of the state terror caused by the NSO Group's spyware <i>Pegasus</i>. The spyware is allegedly capable of activating personal smartphone cameras and microphones, hence leveraging the widespread use of smartphones to gain intelligence. <div class="marginnote">[2] I'm working on a thesis that as things become more niche, the need to standardize and homogenize increases also. Pegasus seems to be exploiting this thesis, if true.</div> Digital Forensics developed digitalviolence to counter the use of spyware like Pegasus towards questionable, unethical purposes. [2]</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/case-watch-toxic-commercial-weedkiller-fuels-new-mass-tort-2021-07-02/">Herbicide</a> suggested to be linked to Parkinson's disease could fuel a new mass tort. Paraquat is a known toxic herbicide marketed by Syngenta and previously sold by USA's Chevron. A tort may arise from data showing that chronic exposure to paraquat may be correlated with Parkinson's disease.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[1] From John Kemp's energy email blast.</div>

	<li><a href="https://twitter.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=92fd2e3ec7962cda008f0732a&id=23e3ae9eb6&e=1c03e42b50">Cars</a> are back in fashion. [1] A primary reason for this resurgence in car ownership is the pandemic, which discouraged the use of public transportation (due to fears of viral transmission). Used car prices and waiting times for driving tests have risen. An interesting observation is that, at least in America, the total distance travelled by car is not even at pre-pandemic levels. I would guess that this discrepancy emerges from the prevalence of remote work and other stay-at-home policies.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[2] From John Kemp's energy email blast.</div>

	<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-seeks-oil-policy-consensus-uae-demands-changes-2021-07-02/">UAE</a> wants OPEC+ to let it raise oil output. OPEC+ is looking to increase oil supply in the market to ease a surge in oil prices. However, UAE have rejected this new deal on the grounds that their maximum production capacity has increased since 2018, so the proposed deal will cut into their production revenues more than it will for Russia and Saudi Arabia.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[3] I really wonder how our ancestors would react if they saw 1. people getting information from these massively vast social graphs and 2. the mediators of these social graphs policing the information.</div>
	<div class="marginnote">[4] It'd be cool to build a GAN with the Twitter misinformation labeller as the adversary.</div>

	<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/twitter-colorful-misinformation-labels/">Twitter</a> rolls out misinformation labels. The labels color-code misleading information, and include a link that takes you to a curated landing page with verified information. The role of social networks in the spread of information (true or un-true alike) is interesting. Social graphs have always been a source of information, but the constant verification of information with social origins is the fascinating bit. [3] I suspect a lot of Americans will call this a rights infringement, but that's a separate conversation altogether. [4]</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-india-move-tens-of-thousands-of-troops-to-the-border-in-largest-buildup-in-decades-11625218201?cx_testId=200&cx_testVariant=cx_10&cx_artPos=0#cxrecs_s">Tensions</a> between China and India rise. Both sides have been fortifying their positions, continuing the escalating narrative since the June 2020 Galwan Valley clash.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[1] From John Kemp's energy email blast.</div>
	<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/us-natgas-companies-put-hydrogen-test-2021-07-01/">Natural gas suppliers</a> [1] experiment with hydrogen blending. Hydrogen blending is a method of reducing carbon emissions from natural gas by mixing hydrogen into natural gas pipelines. Apparently, there is such a thing as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen">green hydrogen</a>, which is hydrogen produced from low-carbon sources (as opposed to the usual fossil fuel sources). The high cost of green hydrogen production seems to be the barrier.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[2] From John Kemp's energy email blast.</div>

	<li><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48536">California</a> [2] and other major regions are at risk of energy shortages this summer. Peak energy demand may increase given the heat wave. California is most at risk because it relies on energy imports, and solar energy output falls in the late afternoon.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[3] A similar mechanism to why increasing interest rates theoretically increases the home currency's value?</div>

	<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/global-tax-overhaul-wins-broad-consensus-but-obstacles-remain">130 countries</a> back a plan for setting the minimum global corporate tax rate at 15%. The minimum tax rate is meant to discourage multinational corporations from shifting their money to lower-tax countries.[3] Lower-tax countries such as Ireland have benefitted from the influx of investments from multi-national companies, so a final agreement could have major repurcussions.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[4] I don't know anything about the housing market, so this is an excuse for me to learn more about it.</div>
	
	<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-07-01/world-s-fastest-property-price-surge-since-financial-crisis-sparks-bidding-wars">Property valuations</a> are soaring globally. I wonder if the pandemic has made people more selective about their living spaces.[4]</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[1] For one, the presenter doesn't gesticulate nor have any facial expressions.</div>

	<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/look-out-language-teachers-a-synthetic-human-could-be-about-to-take-your-job/">Hour One</a>, a startup that creates photo-real presenters, signs a deal with Berlitz. COVID has led to greater acceptance of technological solutions for traditionally offline things, but I'm curious how this turns out. I do think this has the most application in language learning, since being able to see a mouth sounding out words can be crucial for learning pronunciation. However, I'm doubtful that putting a face to text is really more engaging.[1] Also text has the greatest signal density, so by using this presenter, the signal density goes down significantly.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[2] "It's called the little bighorn. That's smart, Mark."</div>

	<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df4f6e4c-9ee5-47ff-aa8f-8c4c328a1f39">Zipline</a>, a drone delivery startup, raises $250 million. Zipline first attacked the African space by making strides in medical supply lines, using drones to deliver vaccines and medicines to local hospitals. Using drones may not usher in a technological revolution, but it reminds me of Carlota Perez's <i>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</i>; in her model, technological revolutions generally start at certain cores (US, Britain, etc.), then diffuse to the peripheries. This appears to demonstrate the opposite phenomenon. Ghana's restrictions against drones may have been more lax, hence providing a nice training ground for Zipline.</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3de60b3b-fa83-466a-b38d-d5cde3680b36">Robinhood</a> faced to pay $70 million to resolve allegations that it misled customers. The psychology surrounding money is fascinating; at least in America, having a lot of money is synonymous with a good life, and I think the behaviors seen on Robinhood are in-line with this thesis.</li>

	<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/the-engineering-daring-that-led-to-the-first-chinese-personal-computer/">Sinotype III</a> and how Chinese characters arrived onto the digital computing scene. Sinotype III was an Apple II with a modified word processor and operating system; it was developed (strangely?) by the Graphic Arts Education and Research Foundation (GARF), an American foundation.</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/chinas-didi-raises-4-billion-us-ipo-source-2021-06-29/">Didi Chuxing</a>, a Chinese ride-hailing company, to raise an expected $4 billion in US IPO. A lot of Didi's ride-sharing comes from taxi-hailing rather than private-car sharing (similar to Kakao Taxi), and with Meituan and Ele.me already popular in the Chinese food delivery market, it'll be interesting to see how Didi grows.</li>

	<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/family-app-life360-announces-2-1m-investment-round-from-celebs-and-influencers/">Life360</a> announces a new investment round of $2.1 million. This trend of wanting to know the locations of your families and friends is an interesting one. I remember it started back in the 2010s with Snapchat announcing their locations feature. Since then, I've had multiple friends ask me to install location-sharing apps, but I never understood why someone would willingly give away his/her location. Maybe the placement of a social graph in physical space?</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-29/sam-altman-s-worldcoin-will-give-free-crypto-for-eyeball-scans?srnd=technology-vp">Worldcoin</a>, a cryptocurrency that requires a retinal scan for identification. As the name suggests, it strives for universal basic income by bypassing government regulation with technology. The relationship between centralized and decentralized systems, and the analogous tension between centralized and decentralized <b>power</b> comes to mind here.</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-29/eighty-year-old-japanese-firm-may-be-key-to-next-gen-chip-tech">Disco Corps</a> is a Japanese company that specializes in precision grinding and dicing equipment, which are essential for semiconductor manufacturing.</li>
