	<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/us-natgas-companies-put-hydrogen-test-2021-07-01/">Natural gas suppliers</a> [2] experiment with hydrogen blending. Hydrogen blending is a method of reducing carbon emissions from natural gas by mixing hydrogen into natural gas pipelines. Apparently, there is such a thing as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen">green hydrogen</a>, which is hydrogen produced from low-carbon sources (as opposed to the usual fossil fuel sources). The high cost of green hydrogen production seems to be the barrier.</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48536">California</a> [3] and other major regions are at risk of energy shortages this summer. Peak energy demand may increase given the heat wave. California is most at risk because it relies on energy imports, and solar energy output falls in the late afternoon.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[3] From John Kemp's energy email blast.</div>

	<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/global-tax-overhaul-wins-broad-consensus-but-obstacles-remain">130 countries</a> back a plan for setting the minimum global corporate tax rate at 15%. The minimum tax rate is meant to discourage multinational corporations from shifting their money to lower-tax countries.[4] Lower-tax countries such as Ireland have benefitted from the influx of investments from multi-national companies, so a final agreement could have major repurcussions.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[4] A similar mechanism to why increasing interest rates theoretically increases the home currency's value?</div>

	<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-07-01/world-s-fastest-property-price-surge-since-financial-crisis-sparks-bidding-wars">Property valuations</a> are soaring globally. I wonder if the pandemic has made people more selective about their living spaces. [5]</li>

	<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/look-out-language-teachers-a-synthetic-human-could-be-about-to-take-your-job/">Hour One</a>, a startup that creates photo-real presenters, signs a deal with Berlitz. COVID has led to greater acceptance of technological solutions for traditionally offline things, but I'm curious how this turns out. I do think this has the most application in language learning, since being able to see a mouth sounding out words can be crucial for learning pronunciation. However, I'm doubtful that putting a face to text is really more engaging.[1] Also text has the greatest signal density, so by using this presenter, the signal density goes down significantly.</li>

	<div class="marginnote">[1] For one, the presenter doesn't gesticulate nor have any facial expressions</div>

	<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df4f6e4c-9ee5-47ff-aa8f-8c4c328a1f39">Zipline</a>, a drone delivery startup, raises $250 million. Zipline first attacked the African space by making strides in medical supply lines, using drones to deliver vaccines and medicines to local hospitals. Using drones may not usher in a technological revolution, but it reminds me of Carlota Perez's <i>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</i>; in her model, technological revolutions generally start at certain cores (US, Britain, etc.), then diffuse to the peripheries. This is the opposite phenomenon. Ghana's restrictions against drones may have been more lax, hence providing a nice training ground for Zipline.</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3de60b3b-fa83-466a-b38d-d5cde3680b36">Robinhood</a> faced to pay $70 million to resolve allegations that it misled customers. The psychology surrounding money is fascinating; at least in America, having a lot of money is synonymous with a good life, and I think the behaviors seen on Robinhood are in-line with this thesis.</li>

	<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/the-engineering-daring-that-led-to-the-first-chinese-personal-computer/">Sinotype III</a> and how Chinese characters arrived onto the digital computing scene. Sinotype III was an Apple II with a modified word processor and operating system; it was developed (strangely?) by the Graphic Arts Education and Research Foundation (GARF), an American foundation.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/chinas-didi-raises-4-billion-us-ipo-source-2021-06-29/">Didi Chuxing</a>, a Chinese ride-hailing company, to raise an expected $4 billion in US IPO. A lot of Didi's ride-sharing comes from taxi-hailing rather than private-car sharing (similar to Kakao Taxi), and with Meituan and Ele.me already popular in the Chinese food delivery market, it'll be interesting to see how Didi grows.</li>
	<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/family-app-life360-announces-2-1m-investment-round-from-celebs-and-influencers/">Life360</a> announces a new investment round of $2.1 million. This trend of wanting to know the locations of your families and friends is an interesting one. I remember it started back in the 2010s with Snapchat announcing their locations feature. Since then, I've had multiple friends ask me to install location-sharing apps, but I never understood why someone would willingly give away his/her location. Maybe the placement of a social graph in physical space?</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-29/sam-altman-s-worldcoin-will-give-free-crypto-for-eyeball-scans?srnd=technology-vp">Worldcoin</a>, a cryptocurrency that requires a retinal scan for identification. As the name suggests, it strives for universal basic income by bypassing government regulation with technology. The relationship between centralized and decentralized systems, and the analogous tension between centralized and decentralized <b>power</b> comes to mind here.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-29/eighty-year-old-japanese-firm-may-be-key-to-next-gen-chip-tech">Disco Corps</a> is a Japanese company that specializes in precision grinding and dicing equipment, which are essential for semiconductor manufacturing.</li>
