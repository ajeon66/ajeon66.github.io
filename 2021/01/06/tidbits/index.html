<p>TIL that evolutionary prediction depends a lot more on random factors than anything else. Random effects have a greater effect on smaller populations than larger ones. Therefore, since organisms with newly budding mutations are few, randomness has a much greater hand in their survival.</p>

<p>This implies that in predicting flu strains, we can rely somewhat on stochastic models like Markov chains. Take a look <a href="http://www.inference.org.uk/sustainable/Kin1982-GenealogyLargePopulations.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Q: Are representations of things more powerful than the things themselves?</h4>
<p>I'm talking about symbols in the Durkheimian sense. Durkheim in his <i>The Elementary Forms of Religious Life</i> suggests that symbols and society symbiotically create each other. The strength that society imbues in the individual is made tangible by the symbol, and the existence of the symbol increases this social strength also.
</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, I will refer to the thing that the symbol represents as the root. For example, the canonical root of the American flag is the United States of America.</p>

<p>Symbols are pervasive. True to the Durkheimian spirit, where there is society, there are symbols. The swastika, the Cross, any flag, etc. are all examples of symbols.</p>

<p>It's possible to believe that the symbol has more power than its root, but any description is always relative. In this case, the appearance of power has a lot to do with the information density of the symbol i.e. the information per storage space ratio.</p>

<p>Think about the word "apple". "Apple" is a symbol, and its root is an actual apple. If I tell you the word "apple", you will most likely imagine an apple. But the secret is that you do not simply see the image of an apple in your mind's eye. You can taste, feel, and smell the apple - the apple in your imagination is actually pseudo-"real". The five letters in the word "apple" are sufficient to evoke an entire pseudo-"real" object, complete with perceptive capability. Therefore, the information density of the word "apple" is extremely high, as it is sufficient to convey an extraordinary amount of information in just five letters.</p>

<p>Returning to symbols, symbols are essentially data compressions like the word "apple". Capable of expressing concepts of unimaginable magnitude, the extremely high information density of symbols give the impression that a symbol is more powerful than its root. Furthermore, notice that most symbols actually have multiple roots. For example, the American flag symbolizes America, democracy, white supremacy, etc. Symbols, with their infinite storage space and flexibility,  make them extremely potent (or at least seem that way).</p>
