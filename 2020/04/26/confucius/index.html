				<h1>Papa Confucius</h1>
				<p>I spent the majority of my military service reading and studying The Analects of Confucius. Here are some of my favorite quotes.</p>

			<h2>Gentleman. 【君子】</h2>
<h4>"There are people who are not humane 【仁】 although they are gentleman, aren't there? But there is no such thing as someone who is humane although he is a small man 【小人】."</h4>
<ul>
	<li>This quote appears towards the end of the Analects. Until then, I had assumed that the gentleman was a perfect human being that all people should aspire to be like, similar to Nietzsche's Ubermensch. However, this quote reveals that even the gentleman is not perfect.</li>
</ul>

<h4>"There are nine things the gentleman concentrates on: in seeing, he concentrates on clarity; in listening, he concentrates on acuteness; in expression, he concentrates on warmness; in demeanour, he concentrates on courtesy; in words, he concentrates on loyalty; in deeds, he concetrates on reverence; when he is in doubt, he concentrates on asking questions; when he is indignent, he concentrates on the problems; and when he sees opportunity for gain, he concentrates on what is right."</h4>
<ul>
	<li>I often return to this one when I am examining my behavior with others. This one may be the most concrete picture of the gentleman in all the Analects.</li>
</ul>

<h4>"The Master cut out four things. He never took anything for granted, he never insisted on certainty, he was never inflexible and never egotistical."</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Yup, definitely sounds like the supreme role model for someone as inflexible as myself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Time and Effort.</h2>
<h4>"When the Master was standing by a stream, he said: 'Things that go past are like this, aren't they? For they do not set aside day or night.'"</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		Time flies. Time does not discriminate.
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>"It is only when the year turns cold that one becomes aware that pine and cypress are the last to fade."</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		You only know the value of things once they disappear. Cliche, I know, but so beautiful.
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>"Just as when making a mound, if I stop when only one basketful is needed to complete it, it will be my own stopping; and just as when levelling the earth, even if I have tipped out only one basketful, the progress made is my own advance."</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The imagery is so beautiful with this one, too.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Road. 【道】</h2>
<h4>"Supreme indeed is the Mean as a virtue, but for a long time it has been rare among the people."</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		When I was young, my mom often told me 中 (가운데 중). I realized many years later (thankfully while I was still in high school) that the middle way consists of being flexible; it means being able to walk in the dark, the light, and the silver lining in between. There are times when one must go to extremes, and times when one must remain balanced.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Government.</h2>
<h4>"To govern means to correct. If you take the lead by being correct, who will dare not to be corrected?"</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The English translation does not do this quote justice. What's cool is that "to govern 【政／정】" and "to correct 【正／정】" sound exactly the same. Literally speaking, to govern means to correct.</li>
</ul>
