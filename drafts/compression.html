<body><h3>on the resolution of contradiction</h3>
<p>Some types of contradictions can be resolved by looking at different frames of reference (FOR). There may be other types of contradictions that don&#39;t buckle under the &quot;FOR attack&quot; but I&#39;ve found this idea to be helpful for pinpointing what causes contradictory behavior. </p>
<p>An object can simultaneously exhibit one property at one FOR but the opposite property at another FOR. For example, a circle is circular when viewed in full, but the circle &quot;straightens out&quot; into a line at a sufficiently small FOR. Although deceivingly simple and almost stupid, this idea isn&#39;t completely useless. In fact, a curved object exhibiting both circular and linear properties by way of varying the sizes of FORs is the inspiration for using derivatives to approximate differentiable curves. Generally, linearity lends itself to easier computation, so having a linear approximation for a complex, bendy curve can be incredibly useful. </p>
<p>Size isn&#39;t the only way to vary FORs. Another useful variation is the positive-negative variation. Note that the name of this variation derives from the artistic notion of positive and negative space. Usually, an object or concept can be broken down into its constituent parts. Especially in social contexts, these parts come together and form <strong>relationships</strong> in order to form the whole. Then the &quot;positive space&quot; of the object consists of the parts themselves, while the &quot;negative space&quot; consists of the relationships between the parts. Positive-negative variation is easily visualized by taking any network and breaking it down into its nodes and edges. The positive space is just the nodes without the edges, and likewise the negative space is just the edges without the nodes. </p>
<p>From a positive FOR, we can see the properties of node, while the negative FOR allows us to observe how nodes behave when they clash with other nodes. I&#39;ve always said it and I&#39;ll say it again: &quot;people aren&#39;t complicated, but it&#39;s when people come together into relationships that things get complicated.&quot;</p>
<p>Another useful variation is the relative-absolute variation. Except for things that live in complete isolation (footnote: I can&#39;t think of one... can you?), most objects or concepts have a relative and an absolute definition. The former defines by way of relationships to other things, whereas the latter seeks to define the thing in its own terms. In other words, a relative definition is dependent, while an absolute definition is independent. </p>
<p>The absolute definitions automatically imply any relative definitions, if and when the absolute definitions exist. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we had absolute definitions for every object and concept, then? Sadly, absolute definitions rarely exist in the social sphere, so relative definitions are all we can work with. </p>
<p>The idea is that as the pixels of a screen get smaller, the overall picture becomes clearer and the divisions between the pixels become less obvious. </p>

<h3>Case study 1: Fractals</h3>
<p>The purest, most beautiful contradiction that can be resolved using size variation is fractals. At the macro-level, fractals are extraordinarily complex and exhibit non-intuitive properties. Sierpinski&#39;s triangle has zero area, but can be drawn to be any size; the Cantor set is an uncountably infinite set with measure zero. However, zooming into any fractal reveals the fundamental fractal rule: self-similarity. The infinite, simple iteration of self-similarity across all different sizes creates complexity. Somehow, the fractal is more than the sum of its parts. (use positive-negative variation here)</p>
<h3>Case study 2: Society and its theory</h3>
<p>Durkheim famously said that society is <em>sui generis</em>. </p>
