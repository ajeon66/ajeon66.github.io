### on the resolution of contradiction

Some types of contradictions can be resolved by looking at different frames of reference (FOR). There may be other types of contradictions that don't buckle under the "FOR attack" but I've found this idea to be helpful for pinpointing what causes contradictory behavior. 

An object can simultaneously exhibit one property at one FOR but the opposite property at another FOR. For example, a circle is circular when viewed in full, but the circle "straightens out" into a line at a sufficiently small FOR. Although deceivingly simple and almost stupid, this idea isn't completely useless. In fact, a curved object exhibiting both circular and linear properties by way of varying the sizes of FORs is the inspiration for using derivatives to approximate differentiable curves. Generally, linearity lends itself to easier computation, so having a linear approximation for a complex, bendy curve can be incredibly useful. 

The most beautiful contradiction that can be resolved using size variation is fractals. At the macro-level, fractals are extraordinarily complex and exhibit non-intuitive properties. For example, Sierpinski's triangle has zero area and Cantor's set is an uncountably infinite set with measure zero. However, zooming into any fractal reveals the fundamental fractal rule: self-similarity. The infinite, simple iteration of self-similarity across all different sizes creates complexity. Somehow, the fractal is more than the sum of its parts, but where the fractals come from . 

Durkheim famously said that society is *sui generis*. 

Size isn't the only way to vary FORs. Another useful variation is the relative-absolute variation. Except for things that live in complete isolation (footnote: I can't think of one... can you?), most objects or concepts have a relative and an absolute definition. The former defines by way of relationships to other things, whereas the latter seeks to define the thing in its own terms. In other words, a relative definition is dependent, while an absolute definition is independent. 

The hot topic of decentralized vs. centralized systems can be analyzed using different FORs. 

Another FOR variation is positive-negative space. 

The idea is that as the pixels of a screen get smaller, the overall picture becomes clearer and the divisions between the pixels become less obvious.
