			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I am a math major at the University of Chicago currently on leave of absence to fulfill my mandatory Korean military service. I am interested in real analysis (probably because that's the only thing I've really studied in college) and combinatorics. I also dabble in other computational studies such as algorithms, probability models, and cryptography. I also enjoy performing close-up card magic, playing the cello, making hip-hop/deep house beats, and reading philosophy.</p>

			<p>This website is just a way for me to get my thoughts down - what I'm up to, what projects I'm working on, what books I'm reading, and the like. </p>

							<td>I took the Honors Calculus sequence during my first year at the University of Chicago, and really enjoyed the small tastes of real analysis! Ergo the logical next step was to dive into the deep blue ocean that is Baby Rudin (thumbs up if you get the reference).</td>
